# Question
Explain what the following status codes mean. Don't just copy and paste the default status text, tell us in your own words what the codes are for.

# Answer

1. 200 - this is the "OK" status code. I'm assuming it means the request sent to the server was successful and there are no issues.

2. 201 - This is the "Created" status code. This means the request was created.

3. 204 - This is the "No Content" status code. This means the request has no content?

4. 404 - This is the famous/infamous "Not Found" status code. This means the request handled by the server was not found or it doesn't exist. 

5. 500 - This is the "Internal Server Error" status code. Something is wrong with the server the request was sent to.
